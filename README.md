<h1>Prime Solo Project</h1>

<h2>MangaStorm</h2>

This is an app I am currently working on that will allow a user to read their favorite manga series quickly and easily.

Using node.js, Express, AngularJS, MongoDB and Bootstrap, it is designed for viewing on computers and tablets.

<h2>In Progress</h2>

Features currently being worked on:

<ul>
  <li>Login / Logout</li>
  <li>Site Search</li>
  <li>User Profile Pages</li>
  <li>Add Different Series to a Favorites List</li>
  <li>Bookmark Users' Last Page Viewed</li>
</ul>
